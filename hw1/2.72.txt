A) sizeof(val) returns a value of the type size_t, which is defined as an
unsigned type in stddef.h. Thus in the expression maxbytes-sizeof(val)>=0,
maxbytes is cast from a signed type to an unsigned type, following C's conversion
rules. Then maxbytes-sizeof(val) gives an unsigned value, which is by definition
always greater than or equal to zero, so the boolean expression always evaluates
to true.

B)
The conditional should be

maxbytes-(int)sizeof(val)>=0

to ensure that the left side of the expression results in a signed type.
