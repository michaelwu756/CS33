The RIO I/O functions are implicitly reentrant because they do not access any
shared variables. However, they can be passed pointers and file descriptors. If
the pointer points at the same location across multiple threads or multiple
threads call read or write on the same file descriptor then unpredictable
behaviour can result. So the caller function must ensure that it passes the
correct arguments into the RIO I/O functions in order for it to behave reentrantly.
